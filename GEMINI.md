# Project Context: Writer

## Directory Overview
This directory (`/Users/bing/project/me/writer`) appears to be the starting point for a new project or a workspace for writing-related content. Currently, it contains no source code or content files.

## Key Files
*   `GEMINI.md`: This file. It serves as the context and instructional guide for the Gemini AI agent interacting with this directory.

## Usage
As an empty directory, the immediate usage is likely to initialize a new software project (e.g., using `npm init`, `cargo new`, etc.) or to begin adding document files for a writing project.

## Future Instructions
When adding files to this directory, please update this `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new structure, technology stack, and conventions.
